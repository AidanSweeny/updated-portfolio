## Getting Started

To get this project running, one must copy the files from the class repository.

### Prerequisites

To have this project run, one must download VS Code off the appstore, and create a GitHub account. Git is also required to run this program, which can be downloaded 

```
$ brew install git. 
```
Homebrew can also be downloaded by inputting the following command in the terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
The different API's that we used have different ways of use. For the rawg API there was no API key necessary for functionality. Anyone that looks up the documentation for the database will be able to use it. The moviedb API and the omdb API both required the user to make an account, and obtain an API key, but they were both free to use. 

### Installing

To install this project one must go through the GitHub website in order to clone this project. Clicking on the cone or download button and then copying the link that comes from that. One can then go into the Terminal application, and use the following command to copy the files:
`
git clone URL
`
This should then be moved to your desktop, or somewhere else on your computer. This will allow access to the html and css files. Opening the html file in a default browser will allow one to observe the website.
